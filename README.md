## iOS Firebase User Authentication + Database - user is able to sign-up/log-in, retrieve user info, update email, reset password, add entries to the database

<br>

> Please be aware that when you open the project in Xcode, make sure you open it through the use of xcworkspace - (The white file) 

<br>

> This project is open-source and can be used by other Developers as startup project for any type of app that requires user Authentication :+1:


<br>

>  :wave: If you are going to use the project in any App, then make sure to create your own database in Firebase Console and link it to the project because the current database is only for the Demo and it will deleted in the future :see_no_evil:
